#### Introduction

Our team at  Super Awesome Data Scientist, Inc. set out to form a partnership with the well known women's tech organization: Women Tech, Women Yes. In order to do so, we set out to implement a strategy to increase awareness, attendance, and ultimately, donations at their annual Summer Gala.

We know that Women Tech, Women Yes increases awareness for their events by placing volunteer staff at subway stations around New York City. With that in mind, we wanted to figure out the best subway stations to place their staff at, and the best times. In order to do so, we analyzed subway turnstile data to find the most trafficked stations, and then incorporated that information with data from yelp to try and hone in on a wealthier demographic to maximize donations.

In doing so, we were able to find the best subway stations for Women Tech, Women Yes to place their volunteer staff in order to maximize donations at their Summer Gala!
